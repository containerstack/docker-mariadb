# MariaDB in Docker container

### Repo info
This repo will build a MariaDB inside a Docker container.<br>
It used the original Dockerfile provided by the MariaDB project team, however for OS X users I have added a extra Dockerfile (located in /osx/Dockerfile) that build one that make mounts working on OS X.
